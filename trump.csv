Over the next 13 months we are going to fight with all of our heart and soul – and we are going to win the Great State of Minnesota in 2020! #TrumpMinneapolis #KAG2020 https://t.co/c3FQnrPJWr
A GREAT evening in Minneapolis Minnesota with incredible American Patriots. THANK YOU! https://t.co/b3UQEo0wPq
The joint statement released with President Bolsonaro in March makes absolutely clear that I support Brazil beginning the process for full OECD membership. The United States stands by that statement and stands by @jairbolsonaro. This article is FAKE NEWS! https://t.co/Hym9ZATHjt

WOW THANK YOU Minneapolis Minnesota — on my way! #KAG2020 https://t.co/Czl6GbCCxN
....We have one of three choices: Send in thousands of troops and win Militarily hit Turkey very hard Financially and with Sanctions or mediate a deal between Turkey and the Kurds!
We defeated 100% of the ISIS Caliphate and no longer have any troops in the area under attack by Turkey in Syria. We did our job perfectly! Now Turkey is attacking the Kurds who have been fighting each other for 200 years....

Big day of negotiations with China. They want to make a deal but do I? I meet with the Vice Premier tomorrow at The White House.
Why isn’t the IG investigating his so-called Whistleblower? All bad info!
The President of the Ukraine just stated again in the strongest of language that President Trump applied no pressure and did absolutely nothing wrong. He used the strongest language possible. That should end this Democrat Scam but it won’t because the Dems &amp; Media are FIXED!
Thank you to @OANN One America News for your fair coverage and brilliant reporting. It is appreciated by many people trying so hard to find a new consistent and powerful VOICE! See you tonight at the Big Rally in Minneapolis.
....the area and start a new war all over again. Turkey is a member of NATO. Others say STAY OUT let the Kurds fight their own battles (even with our financial help). I say hit Turkey very hard financially &amp; with sanctions if they don’t play by the rules! I am watching closely.
Turkey has been planning to attack the Kurds for a long time. They have been fighting forever. We have no soldiers or Military anywhere near the attack area. I am trying to end the ENDLESS WARS. Talking to both sides. Some want us to send tens of thousands of soldiers to....
Where is Hunter Biden? He has disappeared while the Fake News protects his Crooked daddy! https://t.co/Gtwn0nxOTt
...Court Justice &amp; I turned him down (he’s been terrible ever since) Shep Smith @donnabrazile (who gave Crooked Hillary the debate questions &amp; got fired from @CNN) &amp; others @FoxNews doesn’t deliver for US anymore. It is so different than it used to be. Oh well I’m President!
From the day I announced I was running for President I have NEVER had a good @FoxNews Poll. Whoever their Pollster is they suck. But @FoxNews is also much different than it used to be in the good old days. With people like Andrew Napolitano who wanted to be a Supreme....
“Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told reporters Thursday his controversial July call with President Trump involved no bribe blackmail or quid pro quo as impeachment-minded Democrats claim.” This should immediately end the talk of impeachment! https://t.co/0mOTK4dNC3
In case the Kurds or Turkey lose control the United States has already taken the 2 ISIS militants tied to beheadings in Syria known as the Beetles out of that country and into a secure location controlled by the U.S. They are the worst of the worst!
Impeached for what having created the greatest Economy in the history of our Country building our strongest ever Military Cutting Taxes too much? https://t.co/LWxfEcRmj4
A different take! https://t.co/XKnQ6XTF0k
“I don’t think it’s a Whistleblower at all. I think this is an anonymous source for the Democratic Staff in the House of Representatives. This is an insult to real Whistleblowers. Actual Whistleblowers go on to have their whole lives upended.” John Kiriakou  @TuckerCarlson
https://t.co/I6VsoDIQQp
The hardest thing I have to do as President... https://t.co/6bzwh78I00
Sleepy Joe Biden! https://t.co/oZtytImXqq
So pathetic to see Sleepy Joe Biden who with his son Hunter and to the detriment of the American Taxpayer has ripped off at least two countries for millions of dollars calling for my impeachment - and I did nothing wrong. Joe’s Failing Campaign gave him no other choice!
Only 25 percent want the President Impeached which is pretty low considering the volume of Fake News coverage but pretty high considering the fact that I did NOTHING wrong. It is all just a continuation of the greatest Scam and Witch Hunt in the history of our Country!
So why is someone a good or great President if they needed to Spy on someone else’s Campaign in order to win (that didn’t work out so well) and if they were unable to fill 142 important Federal Judgeships (a record by far) handing them all to me to choose. Will have 182 soon!
....DACA stand with all of its negative legal implications the Republicans and Democrats will have a DEAL to let them stay in our Country in very short order. It would actually benefit DACA and be done the right way!
President Obama said that he did not have the right to sign DACA that it will never hold up in court. He signed it anyway! If the Supreme Court upholds DACA it gives the President extraordinary powers far greater than ever thought. If they do what is right and do not let......
So why is someone a good or great President if they needed to Spy on someone else’s Campaign in order to win (that didn’t work out so well) and if they were unable to fill 142 important Federal Judgeships (a record by far) handing them all to me to chose. Will have 182 soon!
Crooked Hillary should try it again! https://t.co/UjfIpZp1FA
True. Should have never been there in the first place! https://t.co/kVXtpB23Wy
Why doesn’t the ICIG do something about this Scam? He should have never let it start a Dem Hoax! https://t.co/UCbObppWbA
Adam Schiff is a disgrace to our Country! https://t.co/4pM3j1GLev

Great support from GOP in fighting the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats! https://t.co/qjskHYkQpD
They don’t have a clue but I do. The USA is doing great despite the Fed! https://t.co/85aW2YGehY
....No Pressure at all said Ukraine! Very congenial a perfect call. The Whistleblower and others spoke BEFORE seeing the Transcript. Now they must apologize to me and stop this ridiculous impeachment!
The so-called Whistleblower before knowing I was going to release the exact Transcript stated that my call with the Ukrainian President was “crazy frightening and completely lacking in substance related to national security.” This is a very big Lie. Read the Transcript!
The Do Nothing Democrats are Con Artists only looking to hurt the Republican Party and President. Their total focus is 2020 nothing more and nothing less. The good news is that WE WILL WIN!!!!
....IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY! We went to war under a false &amp; now disproven premise WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. There were NONE! Now we are slowly &amp; carefully bringing our great soldiers &amp; military home. Our focus is on the BIG PICTURE! THE USA IS GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE!
The United States has spent EIGHT TRILLION DOLLARS fighting and policing in the Middle East. Thousands of our Great Soldiers have died or been badly wounded. Millions of people have died on the other side. GOING INTO THE MIDDLE EAST IS THE WORST DECISION EVER MADE.....
Fighting between various groups that has been going on for hundreds of years. USA should never have been in Middle East. Moved our 50 soldiers out. Turkey MUST take over captured ISIS fighters that Europe refused to have returned. The stupid endless wars for us are ending! https://t.co/Fbcem9i55Z
So make all Member Countries pay not just the United States! https://t.co/IVbE4MqBVl
He should be Impeached for Fraud! https://t.co/lu3xKFQaON
.....The Whistleblower’s lawyer is a big Democrat. The Whistleblower has ties to one of my DEMOCRAT OPPONENTS. Why does the ICIG allow this scam to continue?
The Whistleblower’s facts have been so incorrect about my “no pressure” conversation with the Ukrainian President and now the conflict of interest and involvement with a Democrat Candidate that he or she should be exposed and questioned properly. This is no Whistleblower.....
A Total Scam by the Do Nothing Democrats. For the good of the Country this Wirch Hunt should end now! https://t.co/G2nPapozye
So amazing! https://t.co/UG3DaSkmUc

https://t.co/jZLa4vWXAZ
Wow Just Breaking: “The (big deal) Whistleblower had a ‘PROFESSIONAL TIE’ to 2020 Democratic Candidate.” Washington Examiner @ByronYork  In other words was working with someone who was potentially running against me. Why wasn’t this reported by the ICIG? A Witch Hunt Scam!
“Bob Mueller was pursuing the FBI Director job when he met with President Trump in 2017 Administration officials say.” @FoxNews  Bret Baier and Jake Gibson @seanhannity This is true even though Mueller denied it!
The Greatest Witch Hunt in the history of the USA! https://t.co/6FW11oLBv3
Gasoline Prices in the State of California are MUCH HIGHER than anywhere else in the Nation ($2.50 vs. $4.50). I guess those very expensive and unsafe cars that they are mandating just aren’t doing the trick! Don’t worry California relief is on the way. The State doesn’t get it!
....If there is a Runoff in Louisiana you will have a great new Republican Governor who will Cut your Taxes and Car Insurance and do a fabulous job for you and your family. Vote Republican the Party of Honest Abe Lincoln!
Big Rally in Louisiana on Friday night. Must force a runoff with a Liberal Democrat Governor John Bel Edwards who has let your Taxes and Car Insurance get too high and will never protect your 2nd Amendment. Vote for one of our two great Republicans on Saturday force a runoff!
This is just the beginning thank you to @ByronYork! https://t.co/1ceplqe5MZ

....In fact the “Cops For Trump” T-shirt Web Site CRASHED because of incredible volume but is now back up and running. Proceeds go to the Police Union Charities. See you on Thursday night in Minneapolis!
Radical Left Dem Mayor of Minneapolis Jacob Frey is doing everything possible to stifle Free Speech despite a record sell-out crowd at the Target Center. Presidents Clinton and Obama paid almost nothing! The Minneapolis Police have been incredible....
Friday night in Louisiana will be Great. Big crowd expected. Republicans must get out and vote for either of our two incredible candidates (@DocAbraham &amp; @EddieRispone) so we can stop Left Leaning Governor John Bel Edwards from getting over 50%. We will easily win the runoff! https://t.co/TRiTu71ny2
Hasn’t Adam Schiff been fully discredited by now? Do we have to continue listening to his lies?
https://t.co/bh1FyxfUiA
Get your great T-Shirts “Cops for Trump” at https://t.co/pmhDDXsIlx  REALLY NICE! Thank you to Minneapolis Police Officers &amp; Union! @foxandfriends
Someone please tell the Radical Left Mayor of Minneapolis that he can’t price out Free Speech. Probably illegal! I stand strongly &amp; proudly with the great Police Officers and Law Enforcement of Minneapolis and the Great State of Minnesota! See you Thursday Night!
Thank you to Lt. Bob Kroll of the great Minneapolis Police Department for your kind words on @foxandfriends. The Police are fighting the Radical Left Mayor and his ridiculous Uniform Ban. Actually I LOVE the Cops for Trump shirts. Want to bring some home. I am with you 100%!!!!
I think that Crooked Hillary Clinton should enter the race to try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren. Only one condition. The Crooked one must explain all of her high crimes and misdemeanors including how &amp; why she deleted 33000 Emails AFTER getting “C” Subpoena!
....to see. Importantly Ambassador Sondland’s tweet which few report stated “I believe you are incorrect about President Trump’s intentions. The President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo’s of any kind.” That says it ALL!
I would love to send Ambassador Sondland a really good man and great American to testify but unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court where Republican’s rights have been taken away and true facts are not allowed out for the public....
....understands that while we only had 50 soldiers remaining in that section of Syria and they have been removed any unforced or unnecessary fighting by Turkey will be devastating to their economy and to their very fragile currency. We are helping the Kurds financially/weapons!
We may be in the process of leaving Syria but in no way have we Abandoned the Kurds who are special people and wonderful fighters. Likewise our relationship with Turkey a NATO and Trading partner has been very good. Turkey already has a large Kurdish population and fully....
.....good health at my request Pastor Brunson who had many years of a long prison term remaining. Also remember and importantly that Turkey is an important member in good standing of NATO. He is coming to the U.S. as my guest on November 13th. #ENDENDLESSWARS
So many people conveniently forget that Turkey is a big trading partner of the United States in fact they make the structural steel frame for our F-35 Fighter Jet. They have also been good to deal with helping me to save many lives at Idlib Province and returning in very.....

....the captured ISIS fighters and families. The U.S. has done far more than anyone could have ever expected including the capture of 100% of the ISIS Caliphate. It is time now for others in the region some of great wealth to protect their own territory. THE USA IS GREAT!
As I have stated strongly before and just to reiterate if Turkey does anything that I in my great and unmatched wisdom consider to be off limits I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I’ve done before!). They must with Europe and others watch over...
....down watching over a quagmire &amp; spending big dollars to do so. When I took over our Military was totally depleted. Now it is stronger than ever before. The endless and ridiculous wars are ENDING! We will be focused on the big picture knowing we can always go back &amp; BLAST!
I was elected on getting out of these ridiculous endless wars where our great Military functions as a policing operation to the benefit of people who don’t even like the USA. The two most unhappy countries at this move are Russia &amp; China because they love seeing us bogged.....
The Radical Left Democrats have failed on all fronts so now they are pushing local New York City and State Democrat prosecutors to go get President Trump. A thing like this has never happened to any President before. Not even close!

“Incomes much higher under Trump than Bush Obama.” @foxandfriends And almost everything else is better also (except I am driving the Deep State and the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats CRAZY)!
“IG: DECLASSIFIED INFORMATION CONTRADICTS THE WHISTLEBLOWER.” @foxandfriends  But why are people surprised? The “partisan” Whistleblower was very wrong on what was said on my perfect “no pressure” call with the Ukrainian President. Bring in another Whistleblower from the bench!
We just WON the big court case on Net Neutrality Rules! A great win for the future and speed of the internet. Will lead to many big things including 5G. Congratulations to the FCC and its Chairman Ajit Pai!
...figure the situation out and what they want to do with the captured ISIS fighters in their “neighborhood.” They all hate ISIS have been enemies for years. We are 7000 miles away and will crush ISIS again if they come anywhere near us!
....almost 3 years but it is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars many of them tribal and bring our soldiers home. WE WILL FIGHT WHERE IT IS TO OUR BENEFIT AND ONLY FIGHT TO WIN. Turkey Europe Syria Iran Iraq Russia and the Kurds will now have to.....
.....again said “NO” thinking as usual that the U.S. is always the “sucker” on NATO on Trade on everything. The Kurds fought with us but were paid massive amounts of money and equipment to do so. They have been fighting Turkey for decades. I held off this fight for....
....including capturing thousands of ISIS fighters mostly from Europe. But Europe did not want them back they said you keep them USA! I said “NO we did you a great favor and now you want us to hold them in U.S. prisons at tremendous cost. They are yours for trials.” They.....
The United States was supposed to be in Syria for 30 days that was many years ago. We stayed and got deeper and deeper into battle with no aim in sight. When I arrived in Washington ISIS was running rampant in the area. We quickly defeated 100% of the ISIS Caliphate.....
....This makes Nervous Nancy every bit as guilty as Liddle’ Adam Schiff for High Crimes and Misdemeanors and even Treason. I guess that means that they along with all of those that evilly “Colluded” with them must all be immediately Impeached!
Nancy Pelosi knew of all of the many Shifty Adam Schiff lies and massive frauds perpetrated upon Congress and the American people in the form of a fraudulent speech knowingly delivered as a ruthless con and the illegal meetings with a highly partisan “Whistleblower” &amp; lawyer...

The Biden family was PAID OFF pure and simple! The fake news must stop making excuses for something that is totally inexcusable. Sleepy Joe said he never spoke to the Ukrainian company and then the picture came out where he was playing golf with the company boss and Hunter.....
....and separately got 1.5 Billion Dollars from China despite no experience and for no apparent reason. There is NO WAY these can be legitimate transactions? As lawyers &amp; others have stated as President I have an OBLIGATION to look into possible or probable CORRUPTION!
It is INCREDIBLE to watch and read the Fake News and how they pull out all stops to protect Sleepy Joe Biden and his thrown out of the Military son Hunter who was handed $100000 a month (PlusPlus) from a Ukrainian based company even though he had no experience in energy...

Somebody please wake up Mitt Romney and tell him that my conversation with the Ukrainian President was a congenial and very appropriate one and my statement on China pertained to corruption not politics. If Mitt worked this hard on Obama he could have won. Sadly he choked!
The so-called Whistleblower’s account of my perfect phone call is “way off” not even close. Schiff and Pelosi never thought I would release the transcript of the call. Got them by surprise they got caught. This is a fraud against the American people!

All the Do Nothing Democrats are focused on is Impeaching the President for having a very good conversation with the Ukrainian President. I knew that many people were listening even have a transcript. They have been at this “stuff” from the day I got elected. Bad for Country!
Congressman Adam Schiff should resign for the Crime of after reading a transcript of my conversation with the President of Ukraine (it was perfect) fraudulently fabricating a statement of the President of the United States and reading it to Congress as though mine! He is sick!

....for the privilege of being your President - and doing the best job that has been done in many decades. I am far beyond somebody paying for a hotel room for the evening or filling up a gas tank at an airport I do not own. These Radical Left Democrats are CRAZY! Obama Netflix?
They failed on the Mueller Report they failed on Robert Mueller’s testimony they failed on everything else so now the Democrats are trying to build a case that I enrich myself by being President. Good idea except I will and have always expected to lose BILLIONS of DOLLARS..
“Democrats would rather talk about gun control than get something done.” Governor John Sununu @FoxNews @BillHemmer The big questions are will they “move the goalposts” and is this just a ploy to TAKE YOUR GUNS AWAY? I hope NOT on both counts but I’ll be able to figure it out!
Remember when Iran shot down a drone saying knowingly that it was in their “airspace” when in fact it was nowhere close. They stuck strongly to that story knowing that it was a very big lie. Now they say that they had nothing to do with the attack on Saudi Arabia. We’ll see?
Just Out: “Kavanaugh accuser doesn’t recall incident.” @foxandfriends  DO YOU BELIEVE WHAT THESE HORRIBLE PEOPLE WILL DO OR SAY. They are looking to destroy and influence his opinions - but played the game badly. They should be sued!

...The United States because of the Federal Reserve is paying a MUCH higher Interest Rate than other competing countries. They can’t believe how lucky they are that Jay Powell &amp; the Fed don’t have a clue. And now on top of it all the Oil hit. Big Interest Rate Drop Stimulus!
Producer prices in China shrank most in 3 years due to China’s big devaluation of their currency coupled with monetary stimulus. Federal Reserve not watching? Will Fed ever get into the game? Dollar strongest EVER! Really bad for exports. No Inflation...Highest Interest Rates...
Because we have done so well with Energy over the last few years (thank you Mr. President!) we are a net Energy Exporter &amp; now the Number One Energy Producer in the World. We don’t need Middle Eastern Oil &amp; Gas &amp; in fact have very few tankers there but will help our Allies!

....work that way. I have a better idea. Look at the Obama Book Deal or the ridiculous Netflix deal. Then look at all the deals made by the Dems in Congress the “Congressional Slush Fund” and lastly the IG Reports. Take a look at them. Those investigations would be over FAST!
House Judiciary has given up on the Mueller Report sadly for them after two years and $40000000 spent - ZERO COLLUSION ZERO OBSTRUCTION. So they say OK lets look at everything else and all of the deals that “Trump” has done over his lifetime. But it doesn’t....

Based on the attack on Saudi Arabia which may have an impact on oil prices I have authorized the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve if needed in a to-be-determined amount....
....Then on top of it all Kathleen Parker of all people wrote “In Case You Were Wondering Trump Won The Debate.” True but what is going on at the @washingtonpost? NOT Fake News!
Can’t believe the @washingtonpost wrote a positive front page story “Unity Issue Has Parties Pointing To Trump. GOP Goes All In While Democrats Clash Over Ideology &amp; Tactics. Mr. President We Are With You The Entire Way. REPUBLICANS Have....Coalesced Around Trump.”.....

....The USA should always be paying the the lowest rate. No Inflation! It is only the naïveté of Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve that doesn’t allow us to do what other countries are already doing. A once in a lifetime opportunity that we are missing because of “Boneheads.”
The Federal Reserve should get our interest rates down to ZERO or less and we should then start to refinance our debt. INTEREST COST COULD BE BROUGHT WAY DOWN while at the same time substantially lengthening the term. We have the great currency power and balance sheet.....

One of the greatest and most powerful weapons used by the Fake and Corrupt News Media is the phony Polling Information they put out. Many of these polls are fixed or worked in such a way that a certain candidate will look good or bad. Internal polling looks great the best ever!
ABC/Washington Post Poll was the worst and most inaccurate poll of any taken prior to the 2016 Election. When my lawyers protested they took a 12 point down and brought it to almost even by Election Day. It was a Fake Poll by two very bad and dangerous media outlets. Sad!

As bad as @CNN is Comcast MSNBC is worse. Their ratings are also way down because they have lost all credibility. I believe their stories about me are not 93% negative but actually 100% negative. They are incapable of saying anything positive despite all of the great things...
...But most importantly @CNN is bad for the USA. Their International Division spews bad information &amp; Fake News all over the globe. This is why foreign leaders are always asking me “Why does the Media hate the U.S. sooo much?” It is a fraudulent shame &amp; all comes from the top!
Great news that an activist investor is now involved with AT&amp;T. As the owner of VERY LOW RATINGS @CNN perhaps they will now put a stop to all of the Fake News emanating from its non-credible “anchors.” Also I hear that because of its bad ratings it is losing a fortune.....
94% Approval Rating in the Republican Party a record. Thank you!
House Republicans should allow Chairs of Committees to remain for longer than 6 years. It forces great people and real leaders to leave after serving. The Dems have unlimited terms. While that has its own problems it is a better way to go. Fewer people in the end will leave!

When all of the people pushing so hard for Criminal Justice Reform were  unable to come even close to getting it done they came to me as a group and asked for my help. I got it done with a group of Senators &amp; others who would never have gone for it. Obama couldn’t come close....

The Failing New York Times stated in an article written by Obama flunky Peter Baker (who lovingly wrote Obama book)”Even after the President forecast the storm to include Alabama.” THIS IS NOT TRUE. I said VERY EARLY ON that it MAY EVEN hit Alabama. A BIG DIFFERENCE.....

I agree with @jimcramer the Fed should lower rates. They were WAY too early to raise and Way too late to cut - and big dose quantitative tightening didn’t exactly help either. Where did I find this guy Jerome? Oh well you can’t win them all!
DACA will be going before the Supreme Court. It is a document that even President Obama didn’t feel he had the legal right to sign - he signed it anyway! Rest assured that if the SC does what all say it must based on the law a bipartisan deal will be made to the benefit of all!
....President Obama never had the legal right to sign DACA and he indicated so at the time of signing. But In any event how can he have the right to sign and I don’t have the right to “unsigned.” Totally illegal document which would actually give the President new powers.

If the Fed would cut we would have one of the biggest Stock Market increases in a long time. Badly run and weak companies are smartly blaming these small Tariffs instead of themselves for bad management...and who can really blame them for doing that? Excuses!
....We don’t have a Tariff problem (we are reigning in bad and/or unfair players) we have a Fed problem. They don’t have a clue!
The Euro is dropping against the Dollar “like crazy” giving them a big export and manufacturing advantage...and the Fed does NOTHING! Our Dollar is now the strongest in history. Sounds good doesn’t it? Except to those (manufacturers) that make product for sale outside the U.S.

Bryan Dean Wright former CIA Officer(Dem): “In 2016 we had a Coup. We have to take Comey and others to task. Makes no sense not to prosecute him. Comey got a book deal. I fear for my Country. He tried to kneecap our duly elected president and there are no consequences.” @fox&amp;Fs
The fact that James Comey was not prosecuted for the absolutely horrible things he did just shows how fair and reasonable Attorney General Bill Barr is. So many people and experts that I have watched and read would have taken an entirely different course. Comey got Lucky!
The disastrous IG Report on James Comey shows in the strongest of terms how unfairly I and tens of millions of great people who support me were treated. Our rights and liberties were illegally stripped away by this dishonest fool. We should be given our stolen time back?
An idea liked by many? https://t.co/Ev9uqa1hoj
General Motors which was once the Giant of Detroit is now one of the smallest auto manufacturers there. They moved major plants to China BEFORE I CAME INTO OFFICE. This was done despite the saving help given them by the USA. Now they should start moving back to America again?
https://t.co/ufd7tsGyAx
Establishment of the U.S. Space Command! https://t.co/NQkxxw910S
Perhaps never in the history of our Country has someone been more thoroughly disgraced and excoriated than James Comey in the just released Inspector General’s Report. He should be ashamed of himself!
The Farmers are going to be so happy when they see what we are doing for Ethanol not even including the E-15 year around which is already done. It will be a giant package get ready! At the same time I was able to save the small refineries from certain closing. Great for all!
The Economy is doing GREAT with tremendous upside potential! If the Fed would do what they should we are a Rocket upward!
The totally inaccurate reporting by Lawrence O’Donnell for which he has been forced by NBC to apologize is NO DIFFERENT than the horrible corrupt and fraudulent Fake News that I (and many millions of GREAT supporters) have had to put up with for years. So bad for the USA!
....for the most ridiculous claim of all that Russia Russia Russia or Russian oligarchs co-signed loan documents for me a guarantee. Totally false as is virtually everything else he and much of the rest of the LameStream Media has said about me for years. ALL APOLOGIZE!
Crazy Lawrence O’Donnell who has been calling me wrong from even before I announced my run for the Presidency even being previously forced by NBC to apologize which he did while crying for things he said about me &amp; The Apprentice was again forced to apologize this time.....
Hurricane Dorian looks like it will be hitting Florida late Sunday night. Be prepared and please follow State and Federal instructions it will be a very big Hurricane perhaps one of the biggest!
Puerto Rico is in great shape with Hurricane Dorian taking a largely different route than anticipated. Thank you to FEMA first responders and all for working so hard &amp; being so well prepared. A great result! The bad news Florida get ready! Storm is building and will be BIG!
There has never been a time in the history of our Country that the Media was so Fraudulent Fake or Corrupt! When the “Age of Trump” is looked back on many years from now I only hope that a big part of my legacy will be the exposing of massive dishonesty in the Fake News!
The  Amazon Washington Post and @CNN just did a Fake Interview on Pardons for Aids on the Wall and that I didn’t think the Wall on the Southern Border was that important to stop Illegals wanting to come into our Country. WRONG vitally important. Will make a BIG impact. So bad!
A sad day for the Democrats Kirsten Gillibrand has dropped out of the Presidential Primary. I’m glad they never found out that she was the one I was really afraid of!
Thank you for the support as we MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! https://t.co/qKgwRMSgcf
Another totally Fake story in the Amazon Washington Post (lobbyist) which states that if my Aides broke the law to build the Wall (which is going up rapidly) I would give them a Pardon. This was made up by the Washington Post only in order to demean and disparage - FAKE NEWS!
The Wall is going up very fast despite total Obstruction by Democrats in Congress and elsewhere! https://t.co/12tIW3aNQP https://t.co/2nFIEFppho
....And by the way I’m the best thing that’s ever happened to Puerto Rico!
Puerto Rico is one of the most corrupt places on earth. Their political system is broken and their politicians are either Incompetent or Corrupt. Congress approved Billions of Dollars last time more than anyplace else has ever gotten and it is sent to Crooked Pols. No good!....
Our Federal Reserve cannot “mentally” keep up with the competition - other countries. At the G-7 in France all of the other Leaders were giddy about how low their Interest Costs have gone. Germany is actually “getting paid” to borrow money - ZERO INTEREST PLUS! No Clue Fed!
....I don’t want to Win for myself I only want to Win for the people. The New @FoxNews is letting millions of GREAT people down! We have to start looking for a new News Outlet. Fox isn’t working for us anymore!
....are all in for the Open Border Socialists (or beyond). Fox hires “give Hillary the questions” @donnabrazile Juan Williams and low ratings Shep Smith. HOPELESS &amp; CLUELESS! They should go all the way LEFT and I will still find a way to Win - That’s what I do Win. Too Bad!....
Just watched @FoxNews heavily promoting the Democrats through their DNC Communications Director spewing out whatever she wanted with zero pushback by anchor @SandraSmithFox. Terrible considering that Fox couldn’t even land a debate the Dems give them NOTHING! @CNN &amp; @MSNBC....
Would be very hard for Jeremy Corbyn the leader of Britain’s Labour Party to seek a no-confidence vote against New Prime Minister Boris Johnson especially in light of the fact that Boris is exactly what the U.K. has been looking for &amp; will prove to be “a great one!” Love U.K.
We are tracking closely tropical storm Dorian as it heads as usual to Puerto Rico. FEMA and all others are ready  and will do a great job. When they do let them know it and give them a big Thank You - Not like last time. That includes from the incompetent Mayor of San Juan!
So interesting to read and see all of the free and interesting advice I am getting on China from people who have tried to handle it before and failed miserably - In fact they got taken to the cleaners. We are doing very well with China. This has never happened to them before!
“The infestation of bedbugs at The New York Times office” @OANN  was perhaps brought in by lightweight journalist Bret Stephens a Conservative who does anything that his bosses at the paper tell him to do! He is now quitting Twitter after being called a “bedbug.” Tough guy!
A made up Radical Left Story about Doral bedbugs but Bret Stephens is loaded up with them! Been calling me wrong for years along with the few remaining Never Trumpers - All Losers! https://t.co/KlzzMC40Vt

Can you believe it? I’m at 94% approval in the Republican Party and have Three Stooges running against me. One is “Mr. Appalachian Trail” who was actually in Argentina for bad reasons....
Axios (whatever that is) sat back and said GEEEEE let’s see what can we make up today to embarrass the President? Then they said “why don’t we say he wants to bomb a hurricane that should do it!” The media in our Country is totally out of control!
They do stories so big on Elizabeth “Pocahontas” Warren’s crowd sizes adding many more people than are actually there and yet my crowds which are far bigger get no coverage at all. Fake News!
It is amazing that I can be at 51% with Zogby when the Fake &amp; Corrupt News is almost 100% against me. Great job Mr. President!
The G7 in France was so successful and yet when I came back and read the Corrupt and Fake News and watched numerous networks it was not even recognizable from what actually took place at the Great G7 event!
Looking forward to being with Dan Bishop in two weeks in North Carolina. His opponent believes in Open Borders and Sanctuary Cities and won’t protect your Second Amendment! https://t.co/nSX2yuXAb1
.@JudgeJeanine Pirro is following up her #1 Best Seller with another book that is destined to also be #1 – “Radicals Resistance and Revenge: The Left's Plot to Remake America.” Out today go get it!
The Federal Reserve loves watching our manufacturers struggle with their exports to the benefit of other parts of the world. Has anyone looked at what almost all other countries are doing to take advantage of the good old USA? Our Fed has been calling it wrong for too long!
100% Confirmed! https://t.co/qVsmc9zXk4
Wow! Yet another big storm heading to Puerto Rico. Will it ever end? Congress approved 92 Billion Dollars for Puerto Rico last year an all time record of its kind for “anywhere.”
The G-7 was a great success for the USA and all. LameStream Media coverage bore NO relationship to what actually happened in France - FAKE NEWS. It was GREAT!
No bedbugs at Doral. The Radical Left Democrats upon hearing that the perfectly located (for the next G-7) Doral National MIAMI was under consideration for the next G-7 spread that false and nasty rumor. Not nice!
Starting to look good for the highly respected Prime Minister of the Italian Republic Giuseppe Conte. Represented Italy powerfully at the G-7. Loves his Country greatly &amp; works well with the USA. A very talented man who will hopefully remain Prime Minister!
I have gotten to know President @jairbolsonaro well in our dealings with Brazil. He is working very hard on the Amazon fires and in all respects doing a great job for the people of Brazil - Not easy. He and his country have the full and complete support of the USA!
Starting to look good for the highly respected Prime Minister of the Italian Republic Giuseppi Conte. Represented Italy powerfully at the G-7. Loves his Country greatly &amp; works well with the USA. A very talented man who will hopefully remain Prime Minister!
Just returned to Washington from France and the very successful G-7 only to find that the Fake News is still trying to perpetuate the phony story that I wanted to use Nuclear weapons to blow up hurricanes before they reach shore. This is so ridiculous never happened!

In France we are all laughing at how knowingly inaccurate the U.S. reporting of events and conversations at the G-7 is. These Leaders and many others are getting a major case study of Fake News at it’s finest! They’ve got it all wrong from Iran to China Tariffs to Boris!

The question I was asked most today by fellow World Leaders who think the USA is doing so well and is stronger than ever before happens to be “Mr. President why does the American media hate your Country so much? Why are they rooting for it to fail?”
Big Trade Deal just agreed to with Prime Minister Abe of Japan. Will be great for our Farmers Ranchers and more. Really big Corn purchase!

Such False and Inaccurate reporting thus far on the G-7. The Fake News knows this but they can’t help themselves! Leaving now to have breakfast with Boris J.
....bad Economic times the worse the better anything to make my Election more difficult to win. Well we are having very good meetings the Leaders are getting along very well and our Country economically is doing great - the talk of the world!
Before I arrived in France the Fake and Disgusting News was saying that relations with the 6 others countries in the G-7 are very tense and that the two days of meetings will be a disaster. Just like they are trying to force a Recession they are trying to “will” America into..

North Carolina Governor Cooper Vetoed a Bill that would have required Sheriffs to cooperate with Ice. This is a terrible decision for the great people of North Carolina. He should reverse his decision and get back to the basics of fighting crime!
Looking forward to helping New York City and Governor @andrewcuomo complete the long anticipated and partially built Second Avenue Subway. Would be extended to East 125th Street in Harlem. Long in the making they now have the team that can get it done!
Just had lunch with French President @EmmanuelMacron. Many good things are happening for both of our countries. Big weekend with other world leaders!
“Face It You Probably Got A Tax Cut!” This was a New York Times headline and it is very true. If Republicans take back the House and keep the Senate and Presidency one of our first acts will be to approve a major middle income Tax Cut! Democrats only want to raise your taxes!

When I looked up to the sky and jokingly said “I am the chosen one” at a press conference two days ago referring to taking on Trade with China little did I realize that the media would claim that I had a “Messiah complex.” They knew I was kidding being sarcastic and just....
For all of the Fake News Reporters that don’t have a clue as to what the law is relative to Presidential powers China etc. try looking at the Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977. Case closed!

Just spoke with President @JairBolsonaro of Brazil. Our future Trade prospects are very exciting and our relationship is strong perhaps stronger than ever before. I told him if the United States can help with the Amazon Rainforest fires we stand ready to assist!
...Additionally the remaining 300 BILLION DOLLARS of goods and products from China that was being taxed from September 1st at 10% will now be taxed at 15%. Thank you for your attention to this matter!
...unfair Trading Relationship. China should not have put new Tariffs on 75 BILLION DOLLARS of United States product (politically motivated!). Starting on October 1st the 250 BILLION DOLLARS of goods and products from China currently being taxed at 25% will be taxed at 30%...
....Sadly past Administrations have allowed China to get so far ahead of Fair and Balanced Trade that it has become a great burden to the American Taxpayer. As President I can no longer allow this to happen! In the spirit of achieving Fair Trade we must Balance this very....

Our Country has lost stupidly Trillions of Dollars with China over many years. They have stolen our Intellectual Property at a rate of Hundreds of Billions of Dollars a year &amp; they want to continue. I won’t let that happen! We don’t need China and frankly would be far....
....My only question is who is our bigger enemy Jay Powell or Chairman Xi?
As usual the Fed did NOTHING! It is incredible that they can “speak” without knowing or asking what I am doing which will be announced shortly. We have a very strong dollar and a very weak Fed. I will work “brilliantly” with both and the U.S. will do great...

....that when this Administration’s alternative is no longer available California will squeeze them to a point of business ruin. Only reason California is now talking to them is because the Feds are giving a far better alternative which is much better for consumers!
Henry Ford would be very disappointed if he saw his modern-day descendants wanting to build a much more expensive car that is far less safe and doesn’t work as well because execs don’t want to fight California regulators. Car companies should know....
The Legendary Henry Ford and Alfred P. Sloan the Founders of Ford Motor Company and General Motors are “rolling over” at the weakness of current car company executives willing to spend more money on a car that is not as safe or good and cost $3000 more to consumers. Crazy!

For the record Denmark is only at 1.35% of GDP for NATO spending. They are a wealthy country and should be at 2%. We protect Europe and yet only 8 of the 28 NATO countries are at the 2% mark. The United States is at a much much higher level than that....

So Germany is paying Zero interest and is actually being paid to borrow money while the U.S. a far stronger and more important credit is paying interest and just stopped (I hope!) Quantitative Tightening. Strongest Dollar in History very tough on exports. No Inflation!.....
My proposal to the politically correct Automobile Companies would lower the average price of a car to consumers by more than $3000 while at the same time making the cars substantially safer. Engines would run smoother. Very little impact on the environment! Foolish executives!
.....We are competing with many countries that have a far lower interest rate and we should be lower than them. Yesterday “highest Dollar in U.S.History.” No inflation. Wake up Federal Reserve. Such growth potential almost like never before!
Doing great with China and other Trade Deals. The only problem we have is Jay Powell and the Fed. He’s like a golfer who can’t putt has no touch. Big U.S. growth if he does the right thing BIG CUT - but don’t count on him! So far he has called it wrong and only let us down....

Our Economy is very strong despite the horrendous lack of vision by Jay Powell and the Fed but the Democrats are trying to “will” the Economy to be bad for purposes of the 2020 Election.  Very Selfish! Our dollar is so strong that it is sadly hurting other parts of the world...
Democrats want Open Borders and Crime! So dangerous for our Country. But we are building a big beautiful NEW Wall! I will protect America the Dems don’t know where to start! https://t.co/D0APaAxvVm

Anthony Scaramucci is a highly unstable “nut job” who was with other candidates in the primary who got shellacked &amp; then unfortunately wheedled his way into my campaign. I barely knew him until his 11 days of gross incompetence-made a fool of himself bad on TV. Abused staff...
Great cohesion inside the Republican Party the best I have ever seen. Despite all of the Fake News my Poll Numbers are great. New internal polls show them to be the strongest we’ve had so far! Think what they’d be if I got fair media coverage!

Rep. Tlaib wrote a letter to Israeli officials desperately wanting to visit her grandmother. Permission was quickly granted whereupon Tlaib obnoxiously turned the approval down a complete setup. The only real winner here is Tlaib’s grandmother. She doesn’t have to see her now!
Israel was very respectful &amp; nice to Rep. Rashida Tlaib allowing her permission to visit her “grandmother.” As soon as she was granted permission she grandstanded &amp; loudly proclaimed she would not visit Israel. Could this possibly have been a setup? Israel acted appropriately!

Representatives Omar and Tlaib are the face of the Democrat Party and they HATE Israel!
Wow! The Deputy Editor of the Failing New York Times was just demoted. Should have been Fired! Totally biased and inaccurate reporting. The paper is a Fraud Zero Credibility. Fake News takes another hit but this time a big one!
Our Great Farmers know how important it is to win on Trade. They will be the big winners!
The United States is now by far the Biggest Strongest and Most Powerful Economy in the World it is not even close! As others falter we will only get stronger. Consumers are in the best shape ever plenty of cash. Business Optimism is at an All Time High!

I know President Xi of China very well. He is a great leader who very much has the respect of his people. He is also a good man in a “tough business.” I have ZERO doubt that if President Xi wants to quickly and humanely solve the Hong Kong problem he can do it. Personal meeting?
..deferral to December. It actually helps China more than us but will be reciprocated. Millions of jobs are being lost in China to other non-Tariffed countries. Thousands of companies are leaving. Of course China wants to make a deal. Let them work humanely with Hong Kong first!
Good things were stated on the call with China the other day. They are eating the Tariffs with the devaluation of their currency and “pouring” money into their system. The American consumer is fine with or without the September date but much good will come from the short.....

We are winning big time against China. Companies &amp; jobs are fleeing. Prices to us have not gone up and in some cases have come down. China is not our problem though Hong Kong is not helping. Our problem is with the Fed. Raised too much &amp; too fast. Now too slow to cut....
The Great Charles Payne @cvpayne correctly stated that Fed Chair Jay Powell made TWO enormous mistakes. 1. When he said “mid cycle adjustment.” 2. We’re data dependent.  “He did not do the right thing.” I agree (to put it mildly!). @Varneyco
Tremendous amounts of money pouring into the United States. People want safety!
“So far you’ve had Tariffs imposed on 300 Billion Dollars worth of Chinese products but you can’t tell me that it has hurt our economy...&amp; it really hasn’t led to any kind of serious rise in prices at the consumer level.” @Varneyco  @FoxBusiness  And we are taking in $Billions!
“The Fed has got to do something! The Fed is the Central Bank of the United States not the Central Bank of the World.” Mark Grant  @Varneyco  Correct! The Federal Reserve acted far too quickly and now is very very late. Too bad so much to gain on the upside!

So funny to watch Little Donny Deutsch on TV with his own failing show. When I did The Apprentice Donny would call me (along with @ErinBurnett &amp; others) and BEG to be on that VERY successful show. He had the TV “bug” &amp; I would let him come on though he (&amp; Erin) had very little..

Based on the historic currency manipulation by China it is now even more obvious to everyone that Americans are not paying for the Tariffs – they are being paid for compliments of China and the U.S. is taking in tens of Billions of Dollars! China has always....
China dropped the price of their currency to an almost a historic low. It’s called “currency manipulation.” Are you listening Federal Reserve? This is a major violation which will greatly weaken China over time!
The Media has a big responsibility to life and safety in our Country. Fake News has contributed greatly to the anger and rage that has built up over many years. News coverage has got to start being fair balanced and unbiased or these terrible problems will only get worse!

We cannot let those killed in El Paso Texas and Dayton Ohio die in vain. Likewise for those so seriously wounded. We can never forget them and those many who came before them. Republicans and Democrats must come together and get strong background checks perhaps marrying....
....The flags at the White House will be lowered today through Thursday August 8. Melania and I are praying for all those impacted by this unspeakable act of evil!
Today I authorized the lowering of the flags to half-staff at all Federal Government buildings in honor of the victims of the tragedies in El Paso Texas and Dayton Ohio....
God bless the people of El Paso Texas. God bless the people of Dayton Ohio.
God bless the people of El Paso Texas. God bless the people of Dayton Ohio.
The FBI local and state law enforcement are working together in El Paso and in Dayton Ohio. Information is rapidly being accumulated in Dayton. Much has already be learned in El Paso. Law enforcement was very rapid in both instances. Updates will be given throughout the day!
....Melania and I send our heartfelt thoughts and prayers to the great people of Texas.
Today’s shooting in El Paso Texas was not only tragic it was an act of cowardice. I know that I stand with everyone in this Country to condemn today’s hateful act. There are no reasons or excuses that will ever justify killing innocent people....

Things are going along very well with China. They are paying us Tens of Billions of Dollars made possible by their monetary devaluations and pumping in massive amounts of cash to keep their system going. So far our consumer is paying nothing - and no inflation. No help from Fed!
Countries are coming to us wanting to negotiate REAL trade deals not the one sided horror show deals made by past administrations. They don’t want to be targeted for Tariffs by the U.S.

China is doing very badly worst year in 27 - was supposed to start buying our agricultural product now - no signs that they are doing so. That is the problem with China they just don’t come through. Our Economy has become MUCH larger than the Chinese Economy is last 3 years....
Despite the Democrats wanting very unsafe Open Borders &amp; refusing to change the Loopholes &amp; Asylum tremendous progress is being made the the Southern Border. We all waited because we assumed the Dems would ultimately be forced to change the horrible Immigration Laws.They didn’t!

Baltimore’s numbers are the worst in the United States on Crime and the Economy. Billions of dollars have been pumped in over the years but to no avail. The money was stolen or wasted. Ask Elijah Cummings where it went. He should investigate himself with his Oversight Committee!
Elijah Cummings never even went to the Southern Border and then he screams at the very good people who despite Congresses failure to fix the Loopholes and Asylum make it work (crossings are way down and the Wall is being built). Even with zero Dem help Border getting strong!

....countries that know how to play the game against the U.S. That’s actually why the E.U. was formed....and for China until now the U.S. has been “easy pickens.” The Fed has made all of the wrong moves. A small rate cut is not enough but we will win anyway!
The Fed “raised” way too early and way too much. Their quantitative tightening was another big mistake. While our Country is doing very well the potential wealth creation that was missed especially when measured against our debt is staggering. We are competing with other.....
....even to new heights of success and glory but not with King Elijah and that crew. When the leaders of Baltimore want to see the City rise again I am in a very beautiful oval shaped office waiting for your call!
Crazy Bernie Sanders recently equated the City of Baltimore to a THIRD WORLD COUNTRY! Based on that statement I assume that Bernie must now be labeled a Racist just as a Republican would if he used that term and standard! The fact is Baltimore can be brought back maybe......
The E.U. and China will further lower interest rates and pump money into their systems making it much easier for their manufacturers to sell product. In the meantime and with very low inflation our Fed does nothing - and probably will do very little by comparison. Too bad!
Al Sharpton would always ask me to go to his events. He would say “it’s a personal favor to me.” Seldom but sometimes I would go. It was fine. He came to my office in T.T. during the presidential campaign to apologize for the way he was talking about me. Just a conman at work!
If the Democrats are going to defend the Radical Left “Squad” and King Elijah’s Baltimore Fail it will be a long road to 2020. The good news for the Dems is that they have the Fake News Media in their pocket!
Baltimore under the leadership of Elijah Cummings has the worst Crime Statistics in the Nation. 25 years of all talk no action! So tired of listening to the same old Bull...Next Reverend Al will show up to complain &amp; protest. Nothing will get done for the people in need. Sad!

Under the Trump Administration African American unemployment is the lowest (best) in the history of the United States. No President has come close to doing this before! I also created successful Opportunity Zones. Waiting for Nancy and Elijah to say “Thank you Mr. President!”
If racist Elijah Cummings would focus more of his energy on helping the good people of his district and Baltimore itself perhaps progress could be made in fixing the mess that he has helped to create over many years of incompetent leadership. His radical “oversight” is a joke!
There is nothing racist in stating plainly what most people already know that Elijah Cummings has done a terrible job for the people of his district and of Baltimore itself. Dems always play the race card when they are unable to win with facts. Shame!
“Elijah Cummings has had his chance to address it (crime &amp; conditions in Baltimore) for decades and he hasn’t gotten it done.” @PeteHegseth @foxandfriends  How can he get it done when he just wants to use his Oversight Committee to hurt innocent people and divide our Country!
Speaking of failing badly has anyone seen what is happening to Nancy Pelosi’s district in San Francisco. It is not even recognizeable lately. Something must be done before it is too late. The Dems should stop wasting time on the Witch Hunt Hoax and start focusing on our Country!
....a look the facts speak far louder than words! The Democrats always play the Race Card when in fact they have done so little for our Nation’s great African American people. Now lowest unemployment in U.S. history and only getting better. Elijah Cummings has failed badly!
Someone please explain to Nancy Pelosi who was recently called racist by those in her own party that there is nothing wrong with bringing out the very obvious fact that Congressman Elijah Cummings has done a very poor job for his district and the City of Baltimore. Just take...

....Robert Mueller’s testimony and the Mueller Report itself was a disaster for this illegal Democrat inspired Witch Hunt. It is an embarrassment to the USA that they don’t know how to stop. They can’t help themselves they are totally lost they are Clowns!

We gave Nadler and his Trump hating Dems the complete Mueller Report (we didn’t have to) and even Mueller himself but now that both were a total BUST they say it wasn’t good enough. Nothing will ever be good enough for them. Witch Hunt!
Elijah Cummings spends all of his time trying to hurt innocent people through “Oversight.” He does NOTHING for his very poor very dangerous and very badly run district! Take a look.... #BlacksForTrump2020 https://t.co/seNVESZUht
Democrats don’t care about Border Security. They refuse to give the votes necessary to fix the Loopholes and Asylum. Would be so easy! They want Open Borders which means CRIMECRIMECRIME!
Such a big victory of our Country! “Supreme Court approves Trump Administration plan to use Military Funds for the Wall.” @FoxNews  We will be fully reimbursed for this expenditure over time by other countries.
The Dems are now coming out of shock from the terrible Mueller performance and are starting to spin impeachment all over again. How sick &amp; disgusting and bad for our Country are they. What they are doing is so wrong but they do it anyway. Dems have become the do nothing Party!
The Democrats were trying mightily to revive the badly &amp; irrevocably tarnished Witch Hunt Hoax until Robert Mueller put on the greatest display of ineptitude &amp; incompetence that the Halls of Congress have ever seen. Truth is he had no facts on his side. Nothing he could do!
Consideration is being given to declaring ANTIFA the gutless Radical Left Wack Jobs who go around hitting (only non-fighters) people over the heads with baseball bats a major Organization of Terror (along with MS-13 &amp; others). Would make it easier for police to do their job!
Why is so much money sent to the Elijah Cummings district when it is considered the worst run and most dangerous anywhere in the United States. No human being would want to live there. Where is all this money going? How much is stolen? Investigate this corrupt mess immediately!
....As proven last week during a Congressional tour the Border is clean efficient &amp; well run just very crowded. Cumming District is a disgusting rat and rodent infested mess. If he spent more time in Baltimore maybe he could help clean up this very dangerous &amp; filthy place
Rep Elijah Cummings has been a brutal bully shouting and screaming at the great men &amp; women of Border Patrol about conditions at the Southern Border when actually his Baltimore district is FAR WORSE and more dangerous. His district is considered the Worst in the USA......

So why didn’t the highly conflicted Robert Mueller investigate how and why Crooked Hillary Clinton deleted and acid washed 33000 Emails immediately AFTER getting a SUBPOENA from the United States Congress? She must have GREAT lawyers!
Why didn’t Robert Mueller &amp; his band of 18 Angry Democrats spend any time investigating Crooked Hillary Clinton Lyin’ &amp; Leakin’ James Comey Lisa Page and her Psycho lover Peter S Andy McCabe the beautiful Ohr family Fusion GPS and many more  including HIMSELF &amp; Andrew W?
It was NEVER agreed that Robert Mueller could use one of his many Democrat Never Trumper lawyers to sit next to him and help him with his answers. This was specifically NOT agreed to and I would NEVER have agreed to it. The Greatest Witch Hunt in U.S. history by far!
So Democrats and others can illegally fabricate a crime try pinning it on a very innocent President and when he fights back against this illegal and treasonous attack on our Country they call It Obstruction? Wrong! Why didn’t Robert Mueller investigate the investigators?
So Robert Mueller has now asked for his long time Never Trumper lawyer to sit beside him and help with answers. What’s this all about? His lawyer represented the “basement server guy” who got off free in the Crooked Hillary case. This should NOT be allowed. Rigged Witch Hunt!
The young leaders here today (@TPUSA) are part of a movement unlike anything in the history of our nation. It is a movement about reclaiming YOUR future rebuilding YOUR Country restoring YOUR destiny and renewing the values that are the true source of American GREATNESS! https://t.co/unURpLS8Lc

Just watched Rep. Eric Swalwell be asked endless softball questions by @marthamaccallum on @FoxNews about the phony Witch Hunt. He was just forced out of the Democrat Presidential Primary because he polled at ZERO. Fox sure ain’t what it used to be. Too bad!
Just got back only to hear of a last minute change allowing a Never Trumper attorney to help Robert Mueller with his testimony before Congress tomorrow. What a disgrace to our system. Never heard of this before. VERY UNFAIR SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED. A rigged Witch Hunt!
Budget Deal gives great victories to our Military and Vets keeps out Democrat poison pill riders. Republicans and Democrats in Congress need to act ASAP and support this deal.
....I got to know him over his many years as Chairman of the Police Athletic League for which he devoted so much time and energy. Bob Morgenthau a legend will be greatly missed!
I was saddened to learn of the recent passing of Bob Morgenthau a truly great man! Bob served as a Naval Officer in World War II was an extraordinary US Attorney Manhattan District Attorney and always a warrior for our Country that he loved so dearly....
Leaving for Turning Point USA. Will be speaking to some of the greatest and smartest young people on the planet. See you there!
When an old Wall at the Southern Border that is crumbling and falling over built in an important section to keep out problems is replaced with a brand new 30 foot high steel and concrete Wall the Media says no new Wall has been built. Fake News! Building lots of Wall!
In 2016 I almost won Minnesota. In 2020 because of America hating anti-Semite Rep. Omar &amp; the fact that Minnesota is having its best economic year ever I will win the State! “We are going to be a nightmare to the President” she say. No AOC Plus 3 are a Nightmare for America!
....Tariffs Remittance Fees or all of the above. Guatemala has not been good. Big U.S. taxpayer dollars going to them was cut off by me 9 months ago.
Guatemala which has been forming Caravans and sending large numbers of people some with criminal records to the United States has decided to break the deal they had with us on signing a necessary Safe Third Agreement. We were ready to go. Now we are looking at the “BAN”....

....Best and Newest Military (almost totally rebuilt from the depleted military I took over) in History Best V.A. in History (Choice) and MUCH MUCH MORE. Gee let’s impeach the President. The “Squad” (AOC Plus 3) and other Dems suffer from Trump Derangement Syndrome. Crazy!
Newest Poll: Only 11% in favor of starting ridiculous impeachment hearings. Well let’s see: We have the Best Economy in History the Best Employment Numbers in History Most People Working in History Highest Stock Market in History Biggest Tax and Regulation Cuts in History..

When we rip down and totally replace a badly broken and dilapidated Barrier on the Southern Border something which cannot do the job the Fake News Media gives us zero credit for building a new Wall. We have replaced many miles of old Barrier with powerful new Walls!
....This was a real compromise in order to give another big victory to our Great Military and Vets!
I am pleased to announce that a deal has been struck with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy - on a two-year Budget and Debt Ceiling with no poison pills....
The “Squad” is a very Racist group of troublemakers who are young inexperienced and not very smart. They are pulling the once great Democrat Party far left and were against humanitarian aid at the Border...And are now against ICE and Homeland Security. So bad for our Country!
Going with First Lady to pay our respects to Justice Stevens. Leaving now!
The Report of Iran capturing CIA spies is totally false. Zero truth. Just more lies and propaganda (like their shot down drone) put out by a Religious Regime that is Badly Failing and has no idea what to do. Their Economy is dead and will get much worse. Iran is a total mess!
....But the questions should be asked why were all of Clinton’s people given immunity and why were the text messages of Peter S and his lover Lisa Page deleted and destroyed right after they left Mueller and after we requested them(this is Illegal)?
Highly conflicted Robert Mueller should not be given another bite at the apple. In the end it will be bad for him and the phony Democrats in Congress who have done nothing but waste time on this ridiculous Witch Hunt. Result of the Mueller Report NO COLLUSION NO OBSTRUCTION!...
Fake News Equals the Enemy of the People!
The Mainstream Media is out of control. They constantly lie and cheat in order to get their Radical Left Democrat views out their for all to see. It has never been this bad. They have gone bonkers &amp; no longer care what is right or wrong. This large scale false reporting is sick!
....except for those stated by me &amp; “reams of paper” were never given to me. It is a made up story meant to demean &amp; belittle. The Post had no sources. The facts remain the same that we have 4 Radical Left Congresswomen who have said very bad things about Israel &amp; our Country!
The Amazon Washington Post front page story yesterday was total Fake News. They said “Advisors wrote new talking points and handed him reams of opposition research on the four Congresswomen.” Now really does that sound like me? What advisors there were no talking points....
It is far more costly for the Federal Reserve to cut deeper if the economy actually does in the future turn down! Very inexpensive in fact productive  to move now. The Fed raised &amp; tightened far too much &amp; too fast. In other words they missed it (Big!). Don’t miss it again!
....as we have done it could have been soooo much better. Interest rate costs should have been much lower &amp; GDP &amp; our Country’s wealth accumulation much higher. Such a waste of time &amp; money. Also very unfair that other countries manipulate their currencies and pump money in!
With almost no inflation our Country is needlessly being forced to pay a MUCH higher interest rate than other countries only because of a very misguided Federal Reserve. In addition Quantitative Tightening is continuing making it harder for our Country to compete. As good.....

....Based on the comments made by Senator Schumer he must have seen how dangerous &amp; bad for our Country the Border is. It is not a “manufactured crisis” as the Fake News Media &amp; their Democrat partners tried to portray. He said he wants to meet. I will set up a meeting ASAP!
Senator Chuck Schumer has finally gone to the Southern Border with some Democrat Senators. This is a GREAT thing! Nearby he missed a large group of Illegal Immigrants trying to enter the USA illegally. They wildly  rushed Border Patrol. Some Agents were badly injured....
....Most importantly you have led Israel with a commitment to the values of democracy freedom and equal opportunity that both our nations cherish and share!
Congratulations to Bibi @Netanyahu on becoming the longest serving PM in the history of Israel. Under your leadership Israel has become a technology powerhouse and a world class economy....
I don’t believe the four Congresswomen are capable of loving our Country. They should apologize to America (and Israel) for the horrible (hateful) things they have said. They are destroying the Democrat Party but are weak &amp; insecure people who can never destroy our great Nation!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Presidential Harassment!
The Washington Post Story about my speech in North Carolina and tweet with its phony sources who do not exist is Fake News. The only thing people were talking about is the record setting crowd and the tremendous enthusiasm far greater than the Democrats. You’ll see in 2020!
Big progress at the Border but Dems in Congress must change the Immigration Laws for all to be good! End the Loopholes and much more.
The Great State of West Virginia is producing record setting numbers and doing really well. When I became President it was practically shut down and closed for business. Not anymore!

I like New York Fed President John Williams first statement much better than his second. His first statement is 100% correct in that the Fed “raised” far too fast &amp; too early. Also must stop with the crazy quantitative tightening. We are in a World competition &amp; winning big...
Because of the faulty thought process we have going for us at the Federal Reserve we pay much higher interest rates than countries that are no match for us economically. In other words our interest costs are much higher than other countries when they should be lower. Correct!

....He had the Majority &amp; blew it away with his poor leadership and bad timing. Never knew how to go after the Dems like they go after us. Couldn’t get him out of Congress fast enough!
....When Mitt chose Paul I told people that’s the end of that Presidential run. He quit Congress because he didn’t know how to Win. They gave me standing O’s in the Great State of Wisconsin &amp; booed him off the stage. He promised me the Wall &amp; failed (happening anyway!)......
Paul Ryan the failed V.P. candidate &amp; former Speaker of the House whose record of achievement was atrocious (except during my first two years as President) ultimately became a long running lame duck failure leaving his Party in the lurch both as a fundraiser &amp; leader......

Each of you is fulfilling a vital role in our nation – you are challenging the media gatekeepers and the corporate censors to bring the facts straight to the American People. Together you reach more people than any television broadcast BY FAR! #SocialMediaSummit https://t.co/iWePOOhLgp
...and International. We have only one real currency in the USA and it is stronger than ever both dependable and reliable. It is by far the most dominant currency anywhere in the World and it will always stay that way. It is called the United States Dollar!
....Similarly Facebook Libra’s “virtual currency” will have little standing or dependability. If Facebook and other companies want to become a bank they must seek a new Banking Charter and become subject to all Banking Regulations just like other Banks both National...

To everyone on the Gulf Coast: As you make preparations to protect your homes &amp; loved ones from flooding &amp; the coming storm it is imperative that you heed the directions of @FEMA State &amp; Local Officials. We are working closely w/ them. Please be prepared be careful &amp; be SAFE!
Today I am directing my Administration to explore all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect the free speech rights of ALL AMERICANS. We hope to see more transparency more accountability and more FREEDOM! #SocialMediaSummit https://t.co/i6th5qtfAj

A big subject today at the White House Social Media Summit will be the tremendous dishonesty bias discrimination and suppression practiced by certain companies. We will not let them get away with it much longer. The Fake News Media will also be there but for a limited period..
So happy that I was able to keep Sikorsky Helicopter in the Great State of Pennsylvania. KEEP AMERICA GREAT!

Mexico is doing great at the Border but China is letting us down in that they have not been buying the agricultural products from our great Farmers that they said they would. Hopefully they will start soon!
Will be a big and exciting day at the White House for Social Media!
....conflicted and compromised Mueller again. He said he was “done” after his last 9 minute speech and that he had nothing more to say outside of the No Collusion No Obstruction Report. Enough already go back to work! I won unanimously the big Emoluments case yesterday!
Now the Democrats have asked to see 12 more people who have already spent hours with Robert Mueller and spent a fortune on lawyers in so doing. How many bites at the apple do they get before working on Border Loopholes and Asylum. They also want to interview the highly......
Democrats had to quickly take down a tweet called “Kids In Cages Inhumane Treatment at the Border” because the horrible picture used was from the Obama years. Very embarrassing! @foxandfriends
....And remember a bank that I did use years ago the now badly written about and maligned Deutsche Bank was then one of the largest and most prestigious banks in the world! They wanted my business and so did many others!
The Fake News Media loves the narrative that I didn’t use many banks because the banks didn’t like me. No I didn’t use many banks because I didn’t (don’t) need their money (old fashioned isn’t it?). If I did it would have been very easy for me to get.
....the number of people who are no longer looking for jobs but who are now seeing the opportunity for job growth you’ve got to give the President an A Plus for that.”  Thank you Robert one of our great business leaders!

The White House will be hosting a very big and very important Social Media Summit today. Would I have become President without Social Media? Yes (probably)! At its conclusion we will all go to the beautiful Rose Garden for a News Conference on the Census and Citizenship.
